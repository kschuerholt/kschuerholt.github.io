<!-- # Bio -->
I'm a Researcher and 4th year PhD student at the [AIML Lab, University of St.Gallen](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/) under the supervision of [Damian Borth](https://www.unisg.ch/en/personenverzeichnis/31286cca-f810-49c7-9300-51149d93e1da), where I [investigate populations of Neural Networks](https://hsg-aiml.github.io/2021/11/09/Self_Supervised_Representation_Learning_on_Neural_Network_Weights_for_Model_Characteristic_Prediction.html). My original background is in mechanical engineering with a focus on simulation science and automatic control, which I studied at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). Before my PhD, I interned at the [Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research](https://www.slf.ch/en/index.html) with [Henning Loewe](https://www.slf.ch/en/employees/loewe.html) on the coupled simulation of energy and mass transfer in snowpack.

<!-- # Research Statement -->
I am driven by curiosity and a fascination for research, which allowed me to dive into several exciting fields and eventually led me to machine learning to study learning itself.  My current research focus lies on investigating populations of Neural Networks and has connections to self-supervised learning and transfer, meta and few-shot learning. To that end, I use self-supervised learning methods on populations of Neural Networks to learn abstract, task-invariant representations of models. These representations can then be used for several downstream tasks, such as i) model analysis, ii) generation of new models for abstract knowledge transfer, and iii) model sparsification in representation space. In addition, I am interested in multi-modal learning with data of different levels of abstractions and machine learning for science.
