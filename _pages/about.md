I am a recent PhD graduate from the [AIML Lab, University of St.Gallen](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/), where I was advised by [Damian Borth](https://www.unisg.ch/en/personenverzeichnis/31286cca-f810-49c7-9300-51149d93e1da), and co-adivsed by [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/), and [Xavier Giro-i-Nieto](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/xavier-giro). My research focused on representation learning on neural network weights, specifically investigating populations of neural networks and identifying latent structures by learning hyper-representations. 

During my PhD, I was a **visiting scholar** with [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) at **ICSI Berkeley**, collaborating on scaling hyper-representations to large models and diverse architectures and weight analysis. This collaboration extended to working with [Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/) on identifying and utilizing phase transitions in neural networks. Additionally, I completed a **PhD Research Internship** with [Minmin Chen](https://mchen24.github.io/) at **Google Deepmind**, focusing on data-free methods to mitigate forgetting in large language models.

My original background is in mechanical engineering with a focus on simulation science and automatic control, studied at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). 
I have visited Aalto University in Helsinki through an Erasmus scholarship and interned at Siemens via Jiatong-University in Shanghai as a DAAD PROMOS scholar. Before my PhD, I interned at the [Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research](https://www.slf.ch/en/index.html) with [Henning Loewe](https://www.slf.ch/en/staff/loewe/) on coupled simulations of energy and mass transfer in snowpack. 

## Research Statement

As a PostDoc at AIML Lab, my research focuses on scaling hyper-representations towards foundation models of neural networks, which could allow model initialization to be tailored to a specific task or dataset, as well as how models are tuned or evaluated. 
Further, I continue work on investigating and operationalizing phase transitions in neural network models, which may build understanding on when and why neural network methods perform well. 

I am broadly interested in representation learning, particularly in challenging and impactful domains with sparse and multi-modal data, such as scientific and biomedical applications.
