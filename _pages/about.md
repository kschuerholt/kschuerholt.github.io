<!-- # Bio -->
I am a 4th year PhD Student at [AIML Lab, University of St.Gallen](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/) advised by Damian [Damian Borth](https://www.unisg.ch/en/personenverzeichnis/31286cca-f810-49c7-9300-51149d93e1da), with a focus on self-supervised representation learning on neural network weights. In my PhD, I investigate populations of neural networks and identify latent structure in such populations by learning so-called [hyper-representations.](https://hsg-aiml.github.io/2021/11/09/Self_Supervised_Representation_Learning_on_Neural_Network_Weights_for_Model_Characteristic_Prediction.html). My original background is in mechanical engineering with a focus on simulation science and automatic control, which I studied at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). During my studies, I visited Aalto University in Helsinki via an Erasmus scholarship, as well as Siemens via Jiatong-University in Shanghai as DAAD PROMOS scholar. Before my PhD, I interned at the [Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research](https://www.slf.ch/en/index.html) with [Henning Loewe](https://www.slf.ch/en/employees/loewe.html) on the coupled simulation of energy and mass transfer in snowpack. Currently, I am a visiting scholar with [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) at ICSI in Berkley, where I collaborate on an IARPA project extending hyper-representation for backdoor detection.

<!-- # Research Statement -->
I am driven by curiosity and a fascination for research, which allowed me to dive into several exciting fields and eventually led me to machine learning to study learning itself.  My current research focus lies on investigating populations of Neural Networks and has connections to self-supervised learning and transfer, meta and few-shot learning. To that end, I use self-supervised learning methods on populations of Neural Networks to learn abstract, task-invariant representations of models. These representations can then be used for several downstream tasks, such as i) model analysis, ii) generation of new models for abstract knowledge transfer, and iii) model sparsification in representation space. In addition, I am interested in multi-modal learning with data of different levels of abstractions and machine learning for science.
