## Research Interest

In my PhD, I focused on representation learning on populations of neural networks, and applications in computer vision, natural language processing and physics. I am interested in working on and with representation learning, particularly on multi-modal data and challenging domains with high impact on science and society.

- **Topic:** Learning Hyper-Representations to Mitigate Forgetting in LLMs  
  - **Idea:** Prevented forgetting in LLM fine-tuning by penalizing distance to the pre-trained model in a learned model-representation-space; pre-trained the model-representation on LLM pre-training checkpoint history
  - **Findings (preliminary):** Penalizing distance can reduce overfitting the fine-tuning task and mitigate forgetting
